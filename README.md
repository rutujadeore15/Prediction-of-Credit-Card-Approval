# Project Proposal: Predicting Credit Card Approval

## Introduction

This project proposal aims to predict credit card approval using a dataset containing various customer attributes. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we seek to address critical questions related to creditworthiness assessment, explore the impact of such predictions on the banking sector, and identify potential gaps in knowledge that could benefit future banking practices in India.

### Section 1: Questions to Answer

In this section, we will outline the key questions driving this proposal, emphasizing the importance of predicting a client's creditworthiness in today's banking landscape. We will also explore how these predictions can impact the banking sector and identify potential gaps in knowledge for future applications.

### Section 2: Initial Hypothesis

We will establish initial hypotheses based on the questions we aim to address. Whether through data analysis (DA) or machine learning (ML) tracks, we will identify patterns, important features, and assumptions within the dataset. For the ML track, we will justify the choice of model by comparing relevant cost functions and performance metrics.

### Section 3: Data Analysis Approach

This section will detail the approach to proving or disproving our hypotheses. We will also justify the chosen data analysis approach, including relevant feature engineering techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify important patterns in the data.

### Section 4: Machine Learning Approach

We will outline the machine learning method chosen for predicting credit card approval based on customer information. Justification for the most appropriate model will be provided, along with steps taken to improve model accuracy and a comparison of multiple models.

## Project Context

In today's banking landscape, the need for accurate credit assessment is paramount. The credit card department of banks heavily relies on data science to evaluate credit card applicants. The use of a data-driven system for credit assessment, such as the application scorecard, plays a crucial role in estimating an applicant's level of risk. This project aims to enhance the caliber of credit judgments by leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains various customer attributes such as income, education, marital status, and ownership of assets. Additionally, a labeled dataset provides information on credit application status (approved or rejected). Both datasets will be utilized to train and test the machine learning models for credit card approval prediction.

## SQL Queries

Utilizing MySQL  we will perform specific queries on the cleaned dataset, including grouping customers based on income type, identifying certain demographics, and extracting insightful information related to credit status and customer attributes.

This project proposal lays the foundation for a comprehensive analysis of credit card approval prediction, offering valuable insights into the creditworthiness assessment process and its potential impact on the banking sector.
